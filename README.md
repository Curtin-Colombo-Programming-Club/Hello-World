# HELLO WORLD!

Evolving to understand

## What is **Programming**?

**Programming** is basically giving instructions to a computer to make it perform a specific task. It's like writing a recipe for a computer to follow. The instructions, called **code**, are written in a special language that the computer can understand.

## What is **Coding**?

**Coding** is the hands-on part of programming where you translate your instructions for the computer into a specific language it can understand. It's like writing out the steps of a recipe in a way a computer can follow

## **Programming** and **Coding** in comparison

**Programming** and **Coding** are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two.

**Here's an analogy:**
* **Coding** is like writing individual sentences in a language.
* **Programming** is like writing a whole book, with a plot, characters, and a clear message.

In short, coding is one part of programming. It's the writing part, but it doesn't encompass the entire process of creating a functional program.

## Programming Languages

Machines do not communicate as we do.

The natural language of computers is the binary code — 1 and 0. These represent two states: **on (1)** and **off (0)**.

To communicate with machines who speak binary, we do so in a language that’s closer to our natural language. Such as English, French, or Arabic, whilst being structured in certain specifications.

**Programming Languages** can be categorized as either:
* High-Level Languages
* Low-Level Languages

or

* Interpreter Languages
* Compiled Languages

High-Level programming languages are farther away from the machine language than Low-Level languages.

With a programming language, humans can write instructions for a computer to run in a “human readable format” called the SOURCE CODE.

This source code is then translated into binary using translators such as Interpreters, Compilers or Assemblers so that the computer can understand it.

## So, why learn to code?

If you haven’t given enough thought to it, I’d suggest you start now. Think about why YOU want to code in the first place.

Understanding your motivations will help you determine which programming language to start off with, what sorts of projects you want to complete, and ultimately, what you want to make of your skills.

A few general uses of coding are that it can help you develop your professional skills. Even if you aren’t pursuing a purely technical coding career, it’ll help you gain the ability to grasp abstract concepts and help in problem-solving.

Another cool benefit to coding is that it can help you bring YOUR ideas to life.
If you have a cool concept for a website, app, or game, now you can build it exactly the way you want and share it with the world.

## Why do use **"Hello World"** in programming?

If you’ve had any experience coding, you would know that printing **"Hello World"** is a pretty common first step. Have you thought of why?

Hello World, was first referenced by Brian Kernighan in his book titled *A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language*. 

While it can be used as a basic way to illustrate working syntax for a program, traditionally hello world is used by programmers as it acts as the first words that your program speaks into this world, like a baby’s first words!
