# HELLO WORLD!

Evolving to understand

----------------------------------

## What is **Programming**?

**Programming** is basically giving instructions to a computer to make it perform a specific task. It's like writing a recipe for a computer to follow. The instructions, called **code**, are written in a special language that the computer can understand.

## What is **Coding**?

**Coding** is the hands-on part of programming where you translate your instructions for the computer into a specific language it can understand. It's like writing out the steps of a recipe in a way a computer can follow

## **Programming** and **Coding** in comparison

**Programming** and **Coding** are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle difference between the two.

**Here's an analogy:**
* **Coding** is like writing individual sentences in a language.
* **Programming** is like writing a whole book, with a plot, characters, and a clear message.

In short, coding is one part of programming. It's the writing part, but it doesn't encompass the entire process of creating a functional program.

## Programming Languages

Machines do not communicate as we do.

The natural language of computers is the binary code — 1 and 0. These represent two states: **on (1)** and **off (0)**.

To communicate with machines who speak binary, we do so in a language that’s closer to our natural language. Such as English, French, or Arabic, whilst being structured in certain specifications.

**Programming Languages** can be categorized as either:
* High-Level Languages
* Low-Level Languages

or

* Interpreter Languages
* Compiled Languages

High-Level programming languages are farther away from the machine language than Low-Level languages.

With a programming language, humans can write instructions for a computer to run in a “human readable format” called the SOURCE CODE.

This source code is then translated into binary using translators such as Interpreters, Compilers or Assemblers so that the computer can understand it.

## So, why learn to code?

If you haven’t given enough thought to it, I’d suggest you start now. Think about why YOU want to code in the first place.

Understanding your motivations will help you determine which programming language to start off with, what sorts of projects you want to complete, and ultimately, what you want to make of your skills.

A few general uses of coding are that it can help you develop your professional skills. Even if you aren’t pursuing a purely technical coding career, it’ll help you gain the ability to grasp abstract concepts and help in problem-solving.

Another cool benefit to coding is that it can help you bring YOUR ideas to life.
If you have a cool concept for a website, app, or game, now you can build it exactly the way you want and share it with the world.

## Why do use **"Hello World"** in programming?

If you’ve had any experience coding, you would know that printing **"Hello World"** is a pretty common first step. Have you thought of why?

Hello World, was first referenced by Brian Kernighan in his book titled *A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language*. 

While it can be used as a basic way to illustrate working syntax for a program, traditionally hello world is used by programmers as it acts as the first words that your program speaks into this world, like a baby’s first words!

## So how do you start your coding journey?
### STEP 1: FIGURE OUT WHY YOU WANT TO CODE

if you don’t have an end goal, you may become frustrated and stop learning before you get to the fun.

I want you to think about why you want to know how to code. Think about the projects you want to complete, why this skill excites you, and what resources you have available.

For example, say you want to become a developer to earn more income for your family. Do you know where you want to work and what projects they need developers for? Are you ready to put in the time to learn to code, learn the right programming languages, and build projects that show you have what it takes?

Setting broad goals can be overwhelming so start with smaller, more specific goals. For example, say you want to build a mobile app for your friend who is training for a half-marathon one year from now.

This goal will:
* Help you build the skills you need.
* Give you a sense of which programming language to start with.
* Set a deadline so you can manage your time while learning.

### STEP 2: PICK A LANGUAGE TO LEARN

Think about long term goals;
1.	Are you coding for fun?
2.	For work or study?
3.	Do you have a flexible timeline

Languages like Python, java, HTML and CSS are beginner friendly, have a great supporting community and have a range of applications. Perfect for starting off.

### STEP 3: START LOOKING INTO ONLINE COURSES AND YOUTUBE TUTORIALS

Of course, you have your uni classes to learn and work on.

But also take the time to delve into the many fun and interactive tutorials and classes that are offered free of charge on the internet.

Start small work on the basics and move upwards from there.

A few great places to check out free online courses are sites like
* freeCodeCamp
* W3Schools
* Scaler Topics
* Harvard’s acclaimed Introduction to Computer Science course on edX and the CS50 YouTube channel

### STEP 4: LEARN TOOLS TO MAKE YOUR CODING EASIER
#### Code editors

Are basically the bread and butter of modern coders. Familiarise yourself with code editors like VS Code because they can help you write clean code faster. 

They also have additional perks such 
* Syntax highlighting
* Code lookup
* Built-in terminal environments

#### Console

Learn how to navigate the console (also called a terminal). Familiarize yourself with how to use basic commands whether it be on a Linux terminal or a Windows shell.

#### Operating Systems

Code can be written on a variety of platforms such as Linux, MacOS or Windows. Coding on Linux is quite popular so be sure to be familiar with how it works.

### STEP 5: COMPLETE CODING PROJECTS

Doesn’t matter how many YouTube videos you watch or books you read, you get the mechanics of coding by just doing it!

Your ideas won’t fully materialize in your mind unless you put what you learn into practice. That’s where projects come in.

Pick any language of your choice, find an idea you like to work on and start it.
Keep your projects short at the beginning.

There are also loads of beginner programming projects you can try independently. Some classic projects include:
* A time converter, in which the user submits a number of seconds, and your program gives the equivalent in hours, minutes, days, etc.
* A random number generator, which produces a random number between two values specified by the user.
* A calculator, in which the user specifies their inputs and mathematical operation, and your program gives an output.
* An address book, in which users can submit contact names, and then search for contacts stored in your program.
* An alphabetizer, in which the user offers a list of words, and your program sorts them in alphabetical order.
* A hangman game, in which the user tries to guess a hidden word by inputting letters, and your game gives feedback for correct or incorrect guesses. When the user guesses all the letters to your word, they win.

### STEP 6: STAY IN TOUCH WITH YOUR COMMUNITY

As you progress, you’ll probably encounter issues that, no matter how hard you try, you just can’t crack. This is where a good community or a mentor can help.

Programmers are like-minded people and we are all always learning so don’t be afraid to ask questions, get feedback and make connections with others.

Be sure to check out 
* Stack Overflow, a forum site for programming questions and discussion.
* GitHub, a code repository for open-source projects with an active developer community.
* r/learnprogramming, a subreddit (a microsite on Reddit.com) for beginner coders.

## SOME FINAL TIPS
1.	Be patient with yourself
2.	Get comfortable with the fundamentals 
3.	Write clean code
4.	Use your community, google and chatgpt (not for hard problem solving!)

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Coding/Programming is more than just writing code.

It is about problem solving and more often than not you will spend a lot more time thinking about what to write than actually writing it.

Learning to code is learning to think as computers do, deconstruct problems into their components, and address them with the tools you’re given.

Develop your thinking skills, work hard and eventually you will be able to write some impressive code and build amazing projects!
